####Project description
Three Year Contract is comprised of two identical wooden blocks. Though quite plain in appearance, the circuitry inside both blocks can connect to the cellular network. However, unlike the smartphones in our pockets, TYC has a number of intentional technical limitations. Each unit is only capable of calling the other, and to initiate a call, the user must pick up a block and press it against their forehead. This action activates the device, which then broadcasts sound directly into the callerâ€™s skull via bone conduction. Next, the second phone begins to vibrate, and the call finally connects when both blocks are held in the same manner.

####Thematic Statement
Every once in a while, a new technology makes the world a better place without demanding some sort of major trade-off (e.g. the Polio vaccine). More often, however, our advancements require that society shift to accommodate their less desirable effects. TYC calls our attention to the impossible promise of the smartphone: simultaneous presence both here and somewhere else.
